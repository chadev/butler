# ChadevBot

ChadevBot is a bot built with Butler.

## Running ChadevBot locally

Butler runs on elixir which can be installed from your package manager of choice.

Once elixir is installed you should be able to run:

    $ mix deps.get
    
to pull down all of the necesary dependencies.

You may need to run ChadevBot locally in order to develop plugins and test new features.
The Butler framework provides a repl that can be used for local development.

Starting ChadevBot is easy:

    $ mix run --no-halt

You can then run commands:

    chadev_bot>chadev_bot example
    This is an example response
    chadev_bot>
